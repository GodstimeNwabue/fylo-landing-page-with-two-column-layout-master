## What I Learned

I encountered difficulties while achieving a perfect fit for the background image in the "Stay Productive, Wherever You Are" section. Although I considered using the 'position' property, I initially avoided it in search of a better alternative. Eventually, I discovered a simple workaround on Stack Overflow. I added a div, even though it remained empty, and assigned a class to it before commencing the design process. What are your thoughts on this approach?

Managing social media images also posed a challenge, as I initially believed that I could manipulate them directly from the SVG code. This assumption turned out to be incorrect, and I had to embed them directly into the HTML code, utilizing the "fill" property to finalize the design.

If you encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at "nwabuegodstime@gmail.com".

**Enjoy the building process!** ðŸš€
